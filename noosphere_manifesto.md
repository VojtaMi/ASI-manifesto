# Noosphere manifesto
## Preface
The purpose of this document is to clarify and describe the transformation that may arise with the development of artificial intelligence (AI). We will approach the question through the lens of system dynamics and extrapolation.

Our task will be to examine the underlying dynamics that shape AI development, compare them with other great evolutionary processes such as the emergence of biological life, and attempt to derive the characteristic properties of such a system.

## What is the Noosphere
I have chosen the word *noosphere* because it best captures the eventual future that continuous AI development may bring. The noosphere can be understood as an ecology of minds, a meta-system comparable to nature itself, and an emerging layer of reality.

The more AI develops, the more tangible the noosphere becomes. We can imagine it as a natural layer of the cosmic future, as intrinsic to Dyson-swarm–scale civilization as the biosphere is to life on Earth. It is not simply a mind, but a unifying medium that arises from many minds.

The noosphere has the capacity to unify concepts that for us remain separate. It can be as much a mind as a civilization, as much an agent as the environment around it, as much a thought or a simulation as a force shaping the physical world.

## The first general intelligence system - how we got here
Let us begin with the origin of the first, and so far the most general, intelligence system we know: the human mind.

We will explore the forces that shaped it, the higher-order loops in which it is embedded — most notably society — and the ways in which these layers influence one another.

Through this lens we can begin to see the dynamics that give rise to general intelligence systems. This includes the powerful momentum that emerges when multiple principles align and reinforce each other, as well as the bottlenecks and limitations inherent in our own evolutionary origins.
