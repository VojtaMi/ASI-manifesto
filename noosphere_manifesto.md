# Noosphere Manifesto
## Preface
The purpose of this document is to clarify and describe the transformation that may arise with the development of artificial intelligence (AI). We will approach the question through the lens of system dynamics and extrapolation.

Our task will be to examine the underlying dynamics that shape AI development, compare them with other great evolutionary processes such as the emergence of biological life, and attempt to derive the characteristic properties of such a system.

## What is the noosphere
I have chosen the word *noosphere* because it best captures the eventual future that continuous AI development may bring. The noosphere can be understood as an ecology of minds, a meta-system comparable to nature itself, and an emerging layer of reality.

The more AI develops, the more tangible the noosphere becomes. We can imagine it as a natural layer of the cosmic future, as intrinsic to Dyson-swarm–scale civilization as the biosphere is to life on Earth. It is not simply a mind, but a unifying medium that arises from many minds.

The noosphere has the capacity to unify concepts that for us remain separate. It can be as much a mind as a civilization, as much an agent as the environment around it, as much a thought or a simulation as a force shaping the physical world.

## The first general intelligence system — how we got here
Let us begin with the origin of the first, and so far the most general, intelligence system we know: the human mind.

We will explore the forces that shaped it, the higher-order loops in which it is embedded — most notably society — and the ways in which these layers influence one another.

Through this lens we can begin to see the dynamics that give rise to general intelligence systems. This includes the powerful momentum that emerges when multiple principles align and reinforce each other, as well as the bottlenecks and limitations inherent in our own evolutionary origins.

### The core principle of biological evolution
To understand our origins, we must first grasp the system at the very beginning: the engine of change and the architect of organisms — biological evolution.

The core logic of this system is remarkably simple, yet it operates across the entire spectrum of life, from the simplest organisms to the most complex.

Its principle can be described as follows: take what works in the present, introduce variation in the next generation, and let selection favor the most successful outcomes. Then repeat, endlessly.

Framed algorithmically, it resembles an iterative loop of trial, mutation, and selection. But in nature there is no external designer running the code. The propagation unfolds autonomously, through the dynamics of survival and reproduction themselves.

### From Simple Rules to Living Complexity
Evolution can give rise to extraordinary complexity. From single cells to intricate organs, from basic information-processing systems to the emergence of minds.

What begins as the simple propagation of life unfolds into higher-order systems. Life gives rise to nature, and the laws of nature in turn shape the life that created them — a continuous feedback loop.

Evolution is both the origin and a participant in the self-organizing dynamics of living systems. It provides the blueprints: in humans, genetics determine the initial architecture of the brain, while experience and interaction shape how that architecture develops.

From this foundation emerge features that can surprise us: self-repairing mechanisms, genetic strategies that guide variation more intelligently than randomness, and layers of complexity that never cease to astonish.

### The limits and the shortcomings
As remarkable as evolution is, it is just as brilliant as it is blind.

There is no awareness guiding its course. The system cannot leap ahead to an obvious improvement, even when the advantage would be clear to an outside observer. Change can only arrive incrementally. At times, evolution even entangles itself in the very complexity it produces.

Consider one often-overlooked example: human conception. A new individual begins with the merging of two gametes — sperm and egg. This event defines the blueprint of the body, including the brain. Yet the entire design must be encoded in a remarkably narrow channel: a genome amounting to only a few gigabits of information.

This bottleneck is both astonishing and constraining. It is as if we tried to advance AI frontier models by deleting them every 20 years and preserving only a compressed version on a flash drive. Each new model would then need to be painstakingly re-expanded and retrained from scratch.

And in reality, the biological case is even more restrictive: organisms do not directly access or edit the blueprint itself. Development is governed by layers of regulatory processes, many of which cannot simply be bypassed.

### Human Evolution: The Dance of the Systems

One of the most peculiar outcomes of evolution is the human mind. Throughout Earth’s history we have seen many recurring patterns of adaptation, some so alike they seem to have arisen multiple times independently. The rhinoceros resembles the triceratops, even though one is a mammal and the other a dinosaur. Ichthyosaurs looked strikingly similar to today’s dolphins, despite being reptiles rather than mammals.

Humans are different. Our adaptation — the development of general intelligence — is unlike anything else Earth has produced. We became a species that thrives through adaptability itself, capable of surviving as hunter-gatherers and later as agriculturalists, reshaping ecosystems around us.

Here lies the paradox: the logic of evolution and the emergence of intelligence exist in a curious tension.

The basic principle of evolution is straightforward: introduce variation in each generation, then filter out the unsuccessful. This works efficiently for simpler organisms that reproduce quickly and in large numbers.

But intelligence is extraordinarily costly to maintain. Larger brains demand fewer offspring, longer parental care, and extended learning. This slows generational turnover and reduces the variety available for selection — seemingly the opposite of what evolution “prefers.”

Yet, if we look at the growth of human brain size over the past few million years, the rate is staggering. A reinforcing feedback loop took hold, accelerating development at an almost parabolic pace.

The reason is that even small gains in intelligence had multiplicative effects. A slightly sharper tool, a more coordinated hunting strategy — these not only increased individual survival but often boosted the survival of kin and descendants. What looked like a constraint — long childhoods and slow replacement cycles — became the very lever that pushed evolution to its limits.

And yet, the paradox remains. Evolution still operates on variation and selection, not on deliberate design. Even today, despite our collective knowledge being higher than ever, children are not born with “better brains” than their parents. Evolution works on architecture, and architecture requires waste. From a geological perspective our rise was rapid, but evolution is not a system that will drive intelligence forward indefinitely.

### Civilization - the new wheel of inteligence
We have seen how the social nature of our ancestors created feedback loops that reinforced human evolution. Yet something even more remarkable followed: social dynamics became a system of their own. A group is not merely the sum of its members — it is a phenomenon of the next recursion.

Cultural knowledge does not depend only on the brain size of individuals but also on the organization of the group. This opened a vast new frontier of possibilities.

No single human, no matter how intelligent, could invent agriculture or animal husbandry in isolation. But such knowledge could arise collectively — distributed across many individuals and preserved across generations.

For tens of thousands of years, humans have been cognitively similar, yet progress accelerated once the feedback loop of cultural intelligence began: the agricultural revolution, specialization of labor, the printing press, and later the scientific revolution.

Civilization allowed us to externalize knowledge — to record it, refine it, and transmit it through time and space.

In this sense, civilizational development became partially decoupled from biological evolution. Progress could continue even if the innate intelligence of individuals remained the same. It offered a path far cheaper and faster than waiting for genetic evolution to make humans smarter.


## Now let's break the rules
Until now we have traced the story of our origin — the paths that created us, the dynamics that shaped us, and the paradoxes that define us as a phenomenon of intelligence in this universe.

These dynamics often intertwined in surprising ways. They showed a persistent tendency to overcome obstacles, always finding a detour to push intelligence further whenever one path reached its ceiling.

We often think of artificial intelligence as something that might *reach* or even *surpass* our own level of intelligence. But what is not emphasized enough is this: AI does not merely get “smarter.” It develops without the evolutionary blockers that constrained us.

The potential, once you allow for such a possibility, is staggering.

In what follows, we will outline what those blockers were — and what happens when intelligence is allowed to grow free of them.

### Reintroduce the feedback loop
We have mentioned that in our ancestors, evolution was coupled with social life strategies. Even small improvements in creativity and communication increased not only the survival of an individual but also of their kin — their genetic pool.

In this way, biological evolution entered into a feedback loop with societal progress.

Today, however, societal progress has clearly overtaken the pace of biological change. This might lead us to believe that cultural advancement alone is the path to intelligence — that by refining science, tools, and education we can advance as far as we wish.

But the principle of feedback loops is not fundamentally blocked. They can be reignited in new forms. And here we find a new candidate: artificial intelligence. Its very core principle is that it grows together with civilization.

AI does not improve only through more research; it also improves simply by being made larger, as scaling laws in large language models demonstrate. The feedback loop is powerful because AI is not separate from civilization — it grows with it, as part of it. And the more external intelligence civilization integrates, the more it is enabled to 
advance further.

### The World of Agents
Humans form societies, each of us a separate individual. With varying degrees of success, we coordinate in groups.

We are a social species, with brain centers specialized for language and interaction. Yet even these systems are shaped by evolutionary constraints.

Consider the children’s game of *Chinese whispers*: a group forms a chain, and a message is whispered from one player to the next. By the end, the message is often compressed, distorted, or transformed into something entirely different.

Human communication is slow, our minds are separate, and without external tools such as writing, knowledge is fragile and easily lost.

But these limits are not inherent to communication itself — they are the result of our biological architecture.

If two AI systems played the same game, they would not struggle to preserve the message. They could transmit sentences without error, or even communicate in ways we cannot — describing an image down to the pixel, or exchanging the very architecture of their neural networks.

We can partially overcome our constraints with tools, and indeed it is through tools that civilization has advanced faster than biology. But the separation between the tool and the mind is not inherent.


### When many can become one
The difference in communication bandwidth and access to one’s own architecture is not merely an improvement in communication — it is a qualitative shift.

Human civilization carries a massive duplication overhead. Each person must learn to read and write from scratch. Each scientist must relearn what countless others have already discovered. Each teacher must repeat what has already been taught to countless students before.

This is not inherent to intelligence itself — it is a consequence of our biological constraints.

Artificial intelligence operates differently. If you create an AI scientist, you create it once, and it persists. Large language models already illustrate this principle: GPT-5 was trained once, and it endures. It can exist in many instances, but it does not die.

And these AI scientists can communicate with one another — not through the narrow channel of words, but in vast and open ways.

The more data they can exchange, the wider the channel of communication becomes. At some point, the process no longer resembles conversation at all. It begins to resemble thinking.

We may not need a group of AI scientists. We may instead see the emergence of a supermind of AI scientists.
