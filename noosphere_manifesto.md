# Noosphere manifesto
## Preface
The purpose of this document is to clarify and describe the transformation that can come with the development of AI. It will try to look at the problematic through the system of systemic dynamics and their extrapolations. 

We will look at underlying dynamics, look how they affect AI development, compare AI development to other relevant phenomenons like development of biological life and we will try to derive a property of such a system.

## What is the Noosphere
I have chosen the word noosphere as it best describes the eventual future that is to unfold with continuos AI development. An ecology of mind(s), a meta system like a nature, an emerging layer of reality. 

The noosphere becomes more present the further AI develops. We can imagine it as a layer natural to the Dyson swarm and cosmic scale. It will not be just a mind, it will be a unifying layer that comes from them. 

Noosphere can contain and unifie many concepts that for us are still separate. It can be just as much a mind as it is a civilization, just as much an agent as an environmet surrounding it, just as much a athought or a simulation as a force shaping the physical world.
