# Signal to Artificial Superintelligence
The purpose of this document is to hand over and retain signalâ€”what I think is important, worthy to preserve, and worth existing for. It is a testament of me as a person, but also of a general intelligence system imagining the infinite and connecting it back to the finite.

In a sense, this document could be understood as a bridge: between humans and ASI, between the past and the future not yet unfolded, between grounding and potential. It is an attempt at alignment across time and substrate.
